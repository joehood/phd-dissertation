    simulation of continuous systems via quantized state systems
    (QSS), a new second-order approximation, called second-order
    quantized state systems (QSS2), is proposed. This new
    approximation, which satisfies the same stability and
    convergence properties that were deduced for QSS in previous
    works, also allows reducing the number of calculations with
    respect to the former method. It is shown that in the particular
    case of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, the QSS2 can be
    exactly represented by a DEVS model, and in nonlinear systems,
    an approximated DEVS model can be also obtained. For the LTI
    case, a closed formula giving the necessary quantization that
    allows achieving a bound in the error during the whole
    simulation is deduced. This formula, which stands for both QSS
    and QSS2 approaches, also proves that for any quantization, the
    error is always bounded.",

    abstract = {
    In this paper we introduce new classes of numerical ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers that base their internal discretization method on state quantization instead of time slicing. These solvers have been coined quantized state system (QSS) simulators. The primary result of the research described in this article is a first-order accurate QSS-based stiff system solver, called the backward QSS (BQSS). The numerical properties of this new algorithm are discussed, and it is shown that this algorithm exhibits properties that make it a potentially attractive alternative to the classical numerical ODE solvers. Some simulation examples illustrate the advantages of this method. As a collateral result, a first-order accurate QSS-based solver designed for solving marginally stable systems is briefly outlined as well. This new method, called the centered QSS (CQSS), is successfully applied to a challenging benchmark problem describing a high-order system that is simultaneously stiff and marginally stable. However, the primary emphasis of this article is on the BQSS method, that is, on a stiff system solver based on state quantization.

LIQSS methods were designed to efficiently simulate stiff systems, but they only work when the system has a particular structure. The proposed modification overcomes this limitation, allowing the algorithms to efficiently simulate stiff systems with more general structures. Besides describing the new methods and their algorithmic descriptions, the article analyzes the algorithms performance in the simulation of some complex systems. }

    abstract = { The Linear Implicit Quantized State System (LIQSS) method has been evaluated for suitability in modeling and simulation of long duration mission profiles of Naval power systems which are typically characterized by stiff, non-linear, differential algebraic equations. A reference electromechanical system consists of an electric machine connected to a torque source on the shaft end and to an electric grid at its electrical terminals. The system is highly non-linear and has widely varying rate constants; at a typical steady state operating point, the electrical and electromechanical time constants differ by three orders of magnitude—being 3.2 ms and 2.7 s respectively. Two important characteristics of the simulation—accuracy and computational intensity—both depend on quantization size of the system state variables. At a quantization size of about 1\% of a variable’s maximum value, results from the LIQSS1 method differed by less than 1\% from results computed by well-known continuous-system state-space methods. The computational efficiency of the LIQSS1 method increased logarithmically with increasing quantization size, without significant loss of accuracy, up to some particular quantization size, beyond which the error increased rapidly. For the particular system under study, a “sweet spot” was found at a particular quantum size that yielded both high computational efficiency and good accuracy. }
